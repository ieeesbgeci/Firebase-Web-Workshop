## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running the dev server follow the below steps :

1. Vite requires Node.js version >=12.2.0. However, some templates require a higher Node.js version to work, please upgrade if your package manager warns about it.

2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ruralad/ieee.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the dev server
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
